        <div class="content1">
            <h3>Should I wear mask to protect myself ?</h3>
            <p>Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after
             someone who may have COVID-19. If you are stepping out of your house, you should definitely wear one.
             <br><br>
             <span>Disposable face mask can only be used once.</span> There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge 
             people to use masks wisely. We advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary
             wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks.
             <br><br>
             The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your
             hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 
             meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing.
             <span> Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and 
             cleaning or disposal of masks are essential to make them as effective as possible.</span>
             <br>
            </p>
            <p id="listhead"> <b> Here are the basics of how to wear a mask:</b></p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you 
                    touch it at any time.</li>
                <li>Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.</li>
                <li>When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric 
                    mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.</li>
                <li>Don’t use masks with valves.</li>
