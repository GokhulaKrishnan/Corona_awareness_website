            <p>“<span>Time management</span>” is the process of organizing and planning how to divide your time between specific activities. 
                Good time management enables you to <span>work smarter</span> – not harder – so that you get <span>more done in less time</span>, even when 
                time is tight and pressures are high. Failing to manage your time damages your effectiveness and <span>causes stress</span>.</p>
            <p>It seems that there is never enough time in the day. But, since we all get the same 24 hours, why is it that some 
                people achieve so much more with their time than others? <span>The answer lies in good time management.</span>
                Due to this pandemic time, we've got lots of time to spend. So try to use it in a meaningful way.</p>

            <h3><span id="ld1">Time Management</span> During Lock Down :</h3>
            <h4>The lockdown imposed as part of the battle against Covid-19 pandemic, has also led to the closure of many offices, 
                schools, businesses and most are being run through virtual platforms. With the line between the professional, academic 
                and personal spaces blurring, most are finding it difficult to manage the deadlines, online lectures, household chores, 
                and attending to family needs. Due to the lack of face to face conversations, discussions, many are finding it miserable 
                to work, resulting to lower productivity.</h4>
            <h4>The lockdown has also caused the employees to work from home, becoming a new normal for most of the employees. Working 
                from home saves time and accords choices for working conditions. At the same time this is a difficult to professional and 
                personal while working remotely. Some of the steps that one could take to manage time effectively are:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><span id="ld">Find an exclusive and workspace:</span> Avoid the places that are usually used for relaxation for the purpose of working. The 
                    workspace must let one to concentrate and feel comfortable.</li>
                <li><span id="ld">Set routines and timetables:</span>  It is essential to form a habit and mindset of working/ studying. This is possible with 
                    the help of a timetable, by prioritizing the activities and organizing the tasks which needs to be got done over the 
                    course of the day.</li>
                <li><span id="ld">Stay away from distractions:</span> Staying away from the things that are unnecessary which might grab the attention are 
                    important while working from home. All sources of distractions must be removed from the workspace.</li>
                <li><span id="ld">Plan the day:</span> The day must include the activities like, rest, breaks, exercise, socialize with friends, family, others with the 
                    help of virtual platforms along with the work. Planning helps to pass all the works quickly and effectively.</li>
                <li><span id="ld">Schedule the rest breaks:</span> This will help one to make it their day to day routines and recharge oneself to keep on achieving the goals. 
                    It will also help to maintain an effective work life balance.</li>

                    their day to day lives.</li>
            </ul>

                people getting panicked, anxious while thinking about the pending works, and the uncertainties happening around the world. Therefore, 
                one must strive to keep themselves organized, predictable and clean. Setting up mental zones like, not having food on the bed, work 
                on the sofa, while doing everything in the appropriate time, place will enable one to work smoothly.</h4>
