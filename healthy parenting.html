            <h3 id="Question">What is meant by Good Parenting ?</h3>
            <p>Being a <span>good parent</span> means you need to teach your child the <span>moral</span> in what is right and what is wrong. <span>Setting limits</span> and being 
                consistent are the keys to good discipline. Be <span>kind</span> and firm when enforcing those rules. Focus on the <span>reason behind the child’s behavior.</span> 
                And make it an opportunity to learn for the future, rather than to punish for the past.</p>
            <p><span>Fear, uncertainty, and being holed up</span> at home more to slow the spread of COVID-19​ can make it tough for families to keep a sense of calm. 
                But it's important to help children feel safe, keep healthy routines, manage their emotions and behavior and build resilience.</p>

            <h2>Address Chidren's Fear</h2>
            <h4>Children rely on their parents for safety, both physical and emotional. Reassure your children that you are there for them and that your family will get through 
                this together.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><span><span id="first1">A</span>nswer questions about the pandemic simply & honestly</span>. Talk with children about any frightening news​ they hear. It is OK to say 
                    people are getting sick, but remind them that following safety steps like hand washing , wearing cloth face coverings, and staying 
                    home more will help your family stay healthy.</li>
                <li><span><span id="first1">R</span>ecognize your child's feelings</span>. Guiding questions can help older children and teens work through issues. (“I know it is disappointing not to be able to 
                    do some of the things you did before the pandemic. What are some other ways you can have fun with your friends?")</li>
                <li><span><span id="first1">K</span>eep in touch with loved ones</span>. Children may also worry about a grandparent who is living alone or a relative or friend with an increased risk 
                    of getting COVID-19. When safe, physically distanced visits aren't possible, video chats can help ease their anxiety.</li>
                <li><span><span id="first1">M</span>odel how to manage feelings</span>. Talk through how you are managing your own feelings. (“I am worried about Grandma since I can't go visit her. I 
                    will put a reminder on my phone to call her in the morning and the afternoon until it is safe to see her.")</li>
                <li><span><span id="first1">T</span>ell your child before you leave the house for work or essential errands.</span> In a calm and reassuring voice, tell them where you are going, how 
                    long you will be gone, when you will return, and that you are taking steps to stay safe.</li>
                <li><span><span id="first1">L</span>ook forward.</span> Tell them that scientists are working hard to figure out how to help people who get sick, how to prevent it, and that things will get better.</li>
                <li><span><span id="first1">O</span>ffer extra hugs</span> and say “I love you" more often.</li>

            <h4>During the pandemic, it is more important than ever to maintain bedtime and other routines. They create a sense of order to the day that offers reassurance 
                in a very uncertain time. All children, including teens, benefit from routines that are predictable yet flexible enough to meet individual needs.</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Wake-up routines, getting dressed, breakfast and some active play in the morning, followed by quiet play and snack to transition into schoolwork.</li>

                <p>Even with everyone home together 24/7, set aside some special time with each child. Ideas can include cooking or reading​ together, for example, or 
                    playing a favorite game. You choo​se the time, and let your child choose the activity. Just 10 or 20 minutes of your undivided attention, even if only 
                    once every few days, will mean a lot to your child. Keep cell phones off or on silent so you don't get distracted.​</p>
