                <h2>Myths About <span id="covid">COVID</span></h2>
                <p>Chances are you've heard about a food, drug or other method that claims to prevent, treat or cure coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
                    But while it might be tempting to use a questionable product or method to stay healthy during the pandemic, it's extremely unlikely to 
                    work and might cause serious harm. <br><br> There is a lot of flase information around.People of all ages CAN be infected by the coronavirus. 
                    Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to 
                    becoming severely ill with the virus.
